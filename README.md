# Pollution-based-Intelligent-Navigation-using-Dijkstra-s-Algorithm
In this project we have computed the best route for the user considering the pollution levels and the distance to the destination. The entire project works on a prototype of 6 MQ7 Sensors placed in a graph. The data is computed in Ardiuno IDE and the final distance is sent to the Firebase cloud using ESP8266.
